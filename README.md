2. Better in case of strict regulatory compliance in a project.

- Disadvantages of Waterfall:
  
1. Implementation of changes has been very difficult.
2. Late warnings could cause major problems at the latter end.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

- Agile is best used when:

1. The project or product is a startup or a SaaS where there is room for flexibility.
2. The application would be customer-facing and calls for rapid iterations.
- Example: In the construction of a mobile application with changing features.

- Waterfall is best:

1. Large projects with developed requirements.
2. Government or banking systems that require strict documentation.
- Example: To develop the banking system requiring tedious state compliance.
  
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

- Key Quality Assurance methods:
  
1. Automated testing: Rather faster way to find bugs.
2. Code reviews: Prevents possible issues before deployment.
3. Continuous integration (CI/CD): Makes sure the deployment is stable.
4. User acceptance testing (UAT): Makes sure the product fulfills business needs.
5. Security audits: Important for preventing vulnerabilities.
   
- Reasons that show Quality Assurance is important:
  
1. Prevents costlier post-deployment bug fixes.
2. Enhances user trust and retention.
3. Improves long-term maintainability.
   
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

1. Prevention against scope creep.
2. Synchronizing on the stakeholder expectations.
3. Better resource allocation.

- The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchial division of  a project into smaller, manageable pieces or work packages. It breaks the entire project into distinguishable deliverables in order to maintain clarity in planning, executing, and tracking.

- Benefits of WBS:
  
1. Provides Clarity and Organization – The best project structure is to separate work into logical components.
2. Allows for the Assignment of Tasks – Allows assignment of responsibilities to team members.
3. Leads to Better Cost and Time Estimates – Helps in determining budget and scheduling.
4. Identifies Risks at Different Levels – Identifies risks at different levels during the project.
5. Monitors Progress – Monitors easily, allows focus on delays.
6. Prevents Scope Creep – To ensure that all work that proves necessary is included without including any work that is unnecessary. 


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

- Why project schedule helps:
  
1. It makes sure that all the tasks fall within the time deadline.
2. It manages dependencies throughout tasks.
3. Increases accountability on the part of the team.
   
- How Gantt charts facilitate:
  
1. They provide a visual timeline of tasks.
2. It includes task dependencies.
3. Resource allocation assistance.
   
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

1. Overwhelmed by Tasks and Poor Prioritization: This leaves users panicking and scrambling to meet deadlines and reduce productivity.
2. Flow of Work Chaos and Broken Information: An all-in-one system keeps people organized and efficient.
